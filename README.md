# Research Question
* Why is there an inverse relationship between school funding and Black student enrollment? 
* Does funding, rather than benefit students in lower resource communities, indicate a larger structural dynamic that pushes Black families out of improving school districts? 

# Hypothesis
* Increasing public school funding decreases Black student enrollment. 
* Baseline percentage of Black student enrollment or housing values may modify this effect. 

# Finding
* There is a statistically significant positive correlation between school funding and Black student enrollment in California for our study period and cohort. 
* Possible effect modification by housing values.
